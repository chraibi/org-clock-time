# org-clock-time
Analyse working time clocked with Emacs.

Using the setup suggested in [Keep a Journal in Emacs with Org Roam](https://systemcreafters.net/build-a-second-brain-in-emacs/keep-a-journal/)
all dailies are stored in a specific directory that is still hard-coded in the code 

```
dfiles = "/Users/chraibi/Dropbox/Orgfiles/org-files/org-roam/daily/*.org"
```

Daily data collection routine:

- capture daily tasks
- org-clocking-in and org-clocking-out of tasks
